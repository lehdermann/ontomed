# User Guide for OntoMed

Welcome to the OntoMed User Guide. This document provides comprehensive instructions on how to effectively use the OntoMed framework.

## Key Concepts

### Template
A template in OntoMed is a predefined structure used to generate consistent medical content. Templates can include placeholders for variables and are managed using the `TemplateManager`.

### Generator
The generator is a component that utilizes templates to produce structured content. It fills in the template placeholders with actual data to create meaningful outputs.

### Concept
In the context of OntoMed, a concept represents a unit of medical knowledge. Concepts are stored and managed within the semantic database, allowing for complex querying and integration with other medical data.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lehdermann/OntoMed.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Initial Setup

- Ensure that all environment variables are set correctly by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and modifying it as needed.

## Ontology Management

### Uploading Ontologies via UI

- Navigate to the "Ontology Upload" section in the sidebar.
- Upload your ontology file in RDF, TTL, XML, or JSON-LD format.
- Click "Upload Ontology" to load it into the graph database.
- A success message will confirm the upload.

### Uploading Ontologies via API

- Use the `/api/ontologies/upload` endpoint to upload ontology files.
- The endpoint accepts files in RDF, TTL, XML, or JSON-LD format.
- A successful upload will return a confirmation message.

## Using the Semantic Module

### Connecting to the Database

- Initialize and connect to the graph database using `GraphDatabaseService`.
  ```python
  db_service = GraphDatabaseService()
  db_service.connect()
  ```

### Querying Concepts

- Use `query_concept` to retrieve information about medical concepts.
  ```python
  data = db_service.query_concept("Hypertension")
  ```

## Using the Prompt Module

### Managing Templates

- **TemplateManager**: Manage your templates efficiently.
  ```python
  template_manager = TemplateManager(llm)
  ```

- **EditorManager**: Edit and analyze templates.
  ```python
  editor_manager = EditorManager(llm, template_manager)
  analysis = editor_manager.analyze_template(template)
  ```

- **ExportManager**: Export templates for sharing or backup.
  ```python
  export_manager = ExportManager(llm, template_manager)
  exported_template = export_manager.export_template("template_id")
  ```

## Use Cases

- **Medical Data Integration**: Use OntoMed to integrate and manage medical data from various sources, ensuring consistency and reliability.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate detailed medical reports using structured templates and semantic data.
- **AI-driven Insights**: Leverage AI to provide insights and recommendations based on medical data.

## User Interface Capabilities

The OntoMed framework includes a user-friendly dashboard for managing templates and semantic data. Key features include:

- **Template Management**: Easily create, edit, and organize templates through an intuitive interface.
- **Semantic Data Visualization**: Visualize relationships and data structures using interactive graphs.
- **Real-time Updates**: Monitor changes and updates in real-time with dynamic UI components.
- **Customizable Views**: Tailor the dashboard to your needs with customizable views and settings.

## Advanced Features

- **Customizable Templates**: Create and customize templates to fit specific medical domains or practices.
- **Semantic Querying**: Perform complex queries on medical data using semantic technologies.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Handle real-time data updates and processing with efficient graph operations.

## Interactive Examples

Explore interactive examples using Jupyter Notebooks to see OntoMed in action. These examples cover:
- Setting up and querying the semantic database.
- Creating and managing templates.
- Generating reports and insights.

## Visual Aids

Refer to the architecture diagrams and flowcharts in the `docs` directory to understand the data flow and system architecture.

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, refer to the `docs/api` directory or access the online API documentation [here](#).

## Best Practices

- **Modularity**: Keep components independent with clear interfaces.
- **Extensibility**: Design for easy addition of new features.
- **Robustness**: Implement comprehensive error handling.
- **Maintainability**: Follow coding standards and document thoroughly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your database server is running and accessible.
- **Template Errors**: Validate templates using `PromptValidator` to ensure they meet the required standards.
