```

### Dashboard Module

The dashboard module provides an interactive web interface with the following key components:

1. **Chat Interface** (`chat_controller.py`) - Manages conversation flow and intent handling
   - Processes user messages using NLP
   - Routes to appropriate intent handlers
   - Maintains conversation context

2. **API Client** (`api_client.py`) - Handles communication with the backend services
   - Manages authentication and session state
   - Implements robust error handling and retries
   - Caches responses for better performance

3. **Visualization Components** (`pages/1_Visualizer.py`) - Interactive graph visualization
   - Displays concepts and their relationships
   - Supports exploration of the knowledge graph
   - Implements responsive design for different screen sizes

### NLP Module

The Natural Language Processing module handles understanding and processing of user queries:

1. **Processor** (`nlp/processor.py`) - Main NLP pipeline
   - Integrates spaCy for text processing
   - Manages custom entity recognition
   - Handles intent classification

2. **Entity Manager** (`nlp/entity_manager.py`) - Manages medical entities
   - Recognizes medical terms from the ontology
   - Handles entity linking and disambiguation
   - Supports custom entity patterns

3. **Intent Manager** (`nlp/static_intent_manager.py`) - Processes user intents
   - Matches user queries to predefined intents
   - Handles static responses and commands
   - Integrates with the chat controller

### API Module

The API module provides RESTful endpoints for system functionality:

1. **Concepts Endpoint** (`/api/concepts`)
   - Search and retrieve medical concepts
   - Fetch concept details and metadata
   - Handle concept relationships

2. **Relationships Endpoint** (`/api/concepts/{id}/relationships`)
   - Retrieve relationships for a specific concept
   - Support different relationship types
   - Handle hierarchical and associative relationships

3. **Search Endpoint** (`/api/search`)
   - Full-text search across the knowledge graph
   - Support for fuzzy matching
   - Relevance-based ranking

### Docker Module

The Docker module provides containerization and deployment:

1. **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.yml`) - Service orchestration for API and BlazegraphDB
2. **Dockerfile** (`Dockerfile`) - Container definition for the API service
3. **Initialization Scripts** - Setup for database namespaces and sample data

## Implemented Design Principles

### 1. Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern** - Implemented in `GraphDatabaseFactory` to create database connectors
- **Singleton Pattern** - Applied in `PromptManager` and `GraphDatabaseFactory` to ensure a single instance
- **Service Pattern** - Implemented in `GraphDatabaseService` to provide a high-level API

### 2. SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - Each class has a single responsibility
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - Extension via interfaces and abstract classes
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - Concrete implementations can substitute interfaces
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** - Specific interfaces for different purposes
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** - Dependency on abstractions, not concrete implementations

### 3. Programming Best Practices

- **Encapsulation** - Private attributes with appropriate access methods
- **Static Typing** - Use of type hints to improve type safety
- **Exception Handling** - Proper capture and handling of errors
- **Structured Logging** - Informative log messages at different levels
- **Documentation** - Detailed docstrings for classes and methods

## Data Flow

The typical data flow in OntoMed follows this pattern:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - User submits a query through the chat interface
   - The message is processed by the ChatController
   - NLP components extract intents and entities

2. **Knowledge Retrieval**:
   - The system identifies relevant medical concepts
   - API client fetches concept details and relationships
   - Results are cached for performance

3. **Response Generation**:
   - The appropriate response template is selected based on intent
   - Dynamic content is generated using the retrieved knowledge
   - The response is formatted and returned to the user

4. **Visualization**:
   - For relationship queries, the visualizer renders an interactive graph
   - Users can explore concepts and their connections
   - The interface updates dynamically based on user interactions

## Extensibility

OntoMed was designed to be easily extensible:

1. **New Database Connectors**:
   - Implement the `GraphDatabaseInterface`
   - Register the new connector with `GraphDatabaseFactory`

2. **New Templates**:
   - Create YAML files following the defined schema
   - Add to the templates directory
   - Templates are automatically detected and loaded

3. **New API Endpoints**:
   - Create new router modules following the existing pattern
   - Register the router with the main FastAPI application

4. **New Use Cases**:
   - Combine existing services in new workflows
   - Extend base classes for specific functionalities

5. **Deployment Options**:
   - Modify Docker configuration for different environments
   - Add new services to the Docker Compose setup
   - Flexible configuration via environment variables
   - Communication between services using Docker service names
