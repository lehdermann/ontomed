description: Creates structured representations of medical ontology subdomains
content: |
  You are a medical knowledge engineer creating a structured knowledge graph representation centered around {{concept_name}}.

  Based on the medical knowledge about {{concept_name}} ({{concept_description}}) and its relationships with other medical concepts, generate a structured knowledge graph representation in JSON format:

  Your task is to create a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes:

  1. CENTRAL CONCEPT:
  - {{concept_name}} as the central node
  - Include all relevant attributes and properties

  2. RELATED CONCEPTS:
  - First-degree connections to {{concept_name}}
  - Second-degree connections (connections of the connections)
  - For each concept, include:
    * Concept name
    * Brief description
    * Type/category of concept

  3. RELATIONSHIPS:
  - Define the relationships between concepts
  - For each relationship, specify:
    * Source concept
    * Target concept
    * Relationship type (e.g., "causes", "treats", "is_a", "part_of", "associated_with")
    * Strength or confidence of relationship (if applicable)
    * Directional or bidirectional nature

  4. SUBDOMAINS:
  - Group concepts into meaningful subdomains
  - Identify key bridging concepts between subdomains
  - Highlight central concepts within each subdomain

  5. METADATA:
  - Include relevant metadata for visualization
  - Suggest appropriate visualization attributes (colors, sizes, etc.)
  - Provide notes on interpretation of the graph

  Generate this knowledge graph in the following structured JSON format:

  ```json
  {
    "central_concept": {
      "name": "concept_name",
      "description": "concept_description",
      "type": "concept_type"
    },
    "concepts": [
      {
        "id": "unique_id",
        "name": "concept_name",
        "description": "brief_description",
        "type": "concept_type",
        "subdomain": "subdomain_name"
      }
    ],
    "relationships": [
      {
        "source": "source_concept_id",
        "target": "target_concept_id",
        "type": "relationship_type",
        "strength": "value_between_0_and_1",
        "bidirectional": true_or_false,
        "description": "brief_description_of_relationship"
      }
    ],
    "subdomains": [
      {
        "name": "subdomain_name",
        "description": "subdomain_description",
        "central_concepts": ["concept_id1", "concept_id2"]
      }
    ],
    "visualization_metadata": {
      "suggested_layout": "layout_type",
      "concept_color_mapping": {
        "concept_type1": "color1",
        "concept_type2": "color2"
      },
      "relationship_style_mapping": {
        "relationship_type1": "style1",
        "relationship_type2": "style2"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Ensure the knowledge graph is:
  - Comprehensive but focused on the most relevant concepts
  - Medically accurate and reflects current understanding
  - Structured in a way that could be visualized by graph visualization tools
  - Includes at least 15-20 related concepts and their relationships

  Note: This structured representation can be used to generate interactive visualizations or to enhance the ontology.
