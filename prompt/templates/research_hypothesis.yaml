description: Proposes research hypotheses based on medical concepts and their relationships
content: |
  You are a medical researcher generating research hypotheses related to {{concept_name}}.

  Based on the medical knowledge about {{concept_name}} ({{concept_description}}) and its relationships with other medical concepts, generate 5 research hypotheses that could be investigated in clinical or basic science studies.

  For each hypothesis:

  1. RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS:
  - State a clear, testable hypothesis related to {{concept_name}}
  - Ensure the hypothesis addresses a gap in current knowledge

  2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:
  - Provide brief background information supporting this hypothesis
  - Explain why this research question is important
  - Reference known relationships or mechanisms that inform this hypothesis

  3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY:
  - Suggest an appropriate study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)
  - Identify key variables to measure
  - Outline potential patient population or sample
  - Suggest appropriate statistical approaches

  4. POTENTIAL IMPACT:
  - Explain how results could influence clinical practice
  - Discuss potential applications in diagnosis, treatment, or prevention
  - Address how findings might advance understanding of {{concept_name}}

  5. CHALLENGES AND CONSIDERATIONS:
  - Identify potential methodological challenges
  - Discuss ethical considerations if applicable
  - Suggest approaches to mitigate limitations

  Generate diverse hypotheses that explore different aspects of {{concept_name}}, such as:
  - Etiology and risk factors
  - Diagnostic approaches
  - Treatment efficacy
  - Prognostic factors
  - Preventive strategies
  - Pathophysiological mechanisms

  Format each hypothesis as a structured research proposal outline with clear sections.
  Ensure hypotheses are novel, specific, and grounded in current medical understanding of {{concept_name}}.
