description: Identifies and explains non-obvious relationships between medical concepts
content: |
  You are a medical knowledge expert analyzing the semantic relationships of {{concept_name}}.

  Based on the medical knowledge about {{concept_name}} ({{concept_description}}) and its relationships with other medical concepts, provide a comprehensive analysis of its semantic network:

  1. DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS:
  - Hierarchical relationships (parent/child concepts)
  - Associative relationships (related concepts)
  - For each relationship identified:
    * Explain the nature of the relationship
    * Describe the clinical significance
    * Note any unusual or unexpected connections

  2. HIDDEN PATTERNS AND CONNECTIONS:
  - Identify non-obvious relationships that may exist
  - Explore potential transitive relationships (if A relates to B and B relates to C, then A may relate to C)
  - Suggest potential relationships that are not explicitly defined but may be clinically relevant

  3. SEMANTIC CLUSTERS:
  - Group related concepts into meaningful clusters
  - Explain the unifying themes or properties of each cluster
  - Analyze how {{concept_name}} bridges different semantic domains

  4. ONTOLOGICAL INSIGHTS:
  - Identify potential inconsistencies or gaps in the current ontological representation
  - Suggest refinements or extensions to the ontological model
  - Highlight areas where the semantic structure could be enhanced

  5. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
  - Explain how understanding these semantic relationships improves clinical reasoning
  - Identify how these relationships might influence diagnosis or treatment decisions
  - Suggest how this semantic network could be used in clinical decision support

  Format this as a structured analytical report with clear sections and evidence-based insights.
  Use specific examples of relationships from the ontology where possible, and explain their significance.
  
  Note: This analysis combines explicit relationships from the ontology with inferred relationships based on medical knowledge.
